# Tetris

We all know it. Pretty dope stuff.

Uses [SRS](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/SRS) rotation, the rotation system users didn't realize they want. Handles wallkicks.

Basically an exact copy of the (amazing) [YouTube tutorial by Zigurous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODLzYI4d-J8). This includes their assets and copypasta Tetromino data.

## Goals

- ~~Complete Tutorial~~
- Add proper new peice queue (A bag containing each piece randomly chosen until every piece chosen, then create new bag). "Real" Tetris shouldn't be full random Piece selection.
- Score/Reward
- Scaling Speed on line(s) cleared.
